# Summary

`AQEval` (Air Quality Evaluation) is an `R` package for the routine investigation 
of discrete changes in air quality time-series. The main functions use 
break-point/segmentation (BP/S) methods to detect, characterise and quantify change, 
while other functions build on these to provide a workflow to measure smaller changes 
and/or changes in more complex environments. 

# Statement of Need

Authorities responsible for air quality management are typically required to implement and 
evaluate air quality interventions they adopt [@bradley2019review]. These interventions 
are often costly, disruptive and unpopular [@glazener2019transforming], and the inherent 
variability monitoring data hinders impact assessments 
[@kelly2011impact; @pearce2011quantifying; @jones2012large; @grange2019using]. Various methods 
have been developed to investigate discrete changes in a wide range of time-series 
[see e.g. @reeves2007review; @truong2020selective] and several `R` [@r2025r] packages have 
been developed for their use, e.g. `bcp` [@erdman2008bcp], `changepoint` [@killick2016changepoint], 
`segmented` [@muggeo2008segmented], and `strucchange` [@zeileis2002strucchange]. Some have even 
been applied to air quality time-series (see e.g. @carslaw2006change, @carslaw2007detecting). 
However, many of those tasked with air quality policy assessment, although highly skilled in a 
wide range of monitoring activities, are unlike to be able to dedicate sufficient time and resources 
to the development of in-house expertise in such specialist analyses. `AQEval` was developed to 
address this skill gap. It aligns the inputs and outputs of a number of statistical methods to 
provide a one-package option for anyone interested in using `R` to routinely investigate change 
in air quality data. As many air quality professionals already use the `R` package `openair` 
[@carslaw2012openair; @ropkins2012openair] for more conventional analysis and data visualisation, 
`AQEval` has also been written using `openair` coding conventions to reduce the learning-curve 
typically associated with learning new software.

# Analytical Rationale

The `AQEval` Break-Point/Segment (BP/S) methods involve three steps: finding possible ‘points-of-change’, 
testing these and quantifying ‘regions-of-change’ about the most likely:  

1. Breaks-points are determined using the `strucchange` methods of Zeileis and colleagues 
   [@zeileis2002strucchange; @zeileis2003testing]. Here, a rolling-window approach is applied: 
   a first subset (time-series window TW~0~ in \autoref{fig:1}a) is selected and linear 
   regression modelled; the window advanced (TW~1~ in \autoref{fig:1}a) and a second 
   model built, and so on through the time-series; then, likely points-of-change 
   assigned by comparing the F-Stat scores of sequential models. 
2. In addition to the standard Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) testing used by `strucchange`, 
   `AQEval` also checks all individual break-points are statistically valid (p<0.05), and down-scores 
   less likely combinations. 
3. Finally, the `segmented` methods of Muggeo and colleagues [@muggeo2003estimating; @muggeo2008segmented; 
   @muggeo2017interval] are used to determine regions-of-change about break-points. Here, the confidence 
   intervals for the selected break-points are used as start points, and segments assigned 
   by random walk testing about these points as shown in \autoref{fig:1}b.

\autoref{fig:2} shows the break-point/segment analysis of an NO~2~ time-series from a roadside site 
where a change event (*ca.* 25 $\mu$g.m^-3^; 31%) is detected between 2003-01-11 and 2003-02-19. 

![Standard AQEval break-point/segment analysis (graphical output and report) of an NO~2~ 1998-2005 time-series from a heavily trafficked roadside in the UK.](assets/figure_2.png){#fig:2}  

In some cases changes are small or local air inputs are complex, and time-series may require additional 
pre-processing to successfully isolate obscured change-events. For these, `AQEval` uses Generalized 
Additive Models (GAMs) [using `mgcv` methods, @wood2017generalized; @wood2025generalized] to 
subtract associated variance, by default: 
$$[pollutant] = s_1(day~of~year) + s_2(hour~of~day) + te_1(wind~speed,wind~direction)$$
$$[pollutant]_{isolated} = ([pollutant] - [pollutant]_{predicted}) + mean(pollutant)$$

Where the investigated pollutant concentration, *[pollutant]*, is modelled as a function of 
*day of year*, *hour of day* and *wind speed* and *direction* using a combination of spline 
(*s~1~* and *s~2~*) and tensor (*te~1~*) fit-terms, and the unmodelled component, 
*[pollutant]~isolated~*, is estimated as the mean-centred residual of this model. 

\autoref{fig:3}a shows the break-point analysis of NO~2~ from a nearby but 
less heavily trafficked site where seasonality dominates the time-series, and \autoref{fig:3}b shows the 
smaller (*ca.* 6.6 $\mu$g.m^-3^; 13%) underlying change-event observed at a similar 
time to the large change observed at the more heavily trafficked site in \autoref{fig:2} using 
signal isolation and then break-point/segment analysis (2002-09-09 to 2002-12-21 compared with 
2003-01-11 and 2003-02-19).

This default correction can also be modified to include other potential confounders, e.g. other 
frequency terms (e.g. day of week and/or week of year), background contributions (as 
local variance associated with trends at near-by site not affected by the investigated change), 
or proxies for other local contributors (e.g. other meteorological parameters like air temperature, 
markers for other sources, etc).
