Beta-release package of R code for Air Quality Evaluation.

**AQEval** was developed for use by those tasked with the routine
detection, characterisation and quantification of discrete changes in
air quality time-series, such as identifying the impacts of air quality
policy interventions.

```

If you have the **AQEval** .tar.gz file:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
