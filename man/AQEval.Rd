\description{
R AQEval: A package of R code for the
analysis of discrete change in Air Quality
time-series discrete.
}
\section{AQEval}{

\code{AQEval} was developed for use by those tasked with
the routine detection, characterisation and quantification
of discrete changes in air quality time-series.

The main functions, \code{\link{quantBreakPoints}}
and \code{\link{quantBreakSegments}}, use
break-point/segment (BP/S) methods
based on the consecutive use of methods in the
\code{strucchange} and \code{segmented} \code{R} packages
to first detection (as break-points) and then characterise
and quantify (as segments), discrete changes in
air-quality time-series.

\code{AQEval} functions adopt an \code{openair}-friendly
approach using function and data structures that many
in the air quality research community are already familiar
with.
Most notably, most functions expect supplied data
to be time-series, to be supplied as a single
\code{data.frame} (or similar R object), and for
time-series to be identified by column names.
The main functions are typically structured expect
first the \code{data.frame}, then the name of the
pollutant to be used, then other arguments:

\code{function(data, "polluant.name", ...)}

\code{output <- function(data, "polluant.name", ...)}
}
