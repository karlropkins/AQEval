Air quality and meteorological data packaged
for use with AQEval Examples.

Time-series sources:
\itemize{
 \item \strong{date} Date-and-time-stamp of POSIX class
 (\code{\link{DateTimeClasses}}).
 \item \strong{no2} Nitrogen dioxide downloaded from King's
 College London Archive using \code{importKCL}
 function in \code{openair}.
 \item \strong{bg.no2}  Nitrogen dioxide downloaded from
 the Automatic Urban and Rural Network Archive using
 \code{importAURN} function in \code{openair}.
 \item \strong{ws}, \strong{wd}, \strong{air_temp} Wind
 speed, wind direction and air temperature downloaded from
 NOAA's Integrated Surface Database using \code{importNOAA}
 function in \code{worldmet}.

\description{
Data packaged with AQEval for
use with example code.

\details{
Most of functions in \code{AQEval} adopt the
\code{openair} convention of assuming supplied data is
a single \code{data.frame} or similar.
The data frame was initially adopted for two reasons:
\itemize{
  \item Firstly, air quality data collected and archived
in numerous formats and keeping the import requirements
simple minimises the frustrations associated with data
importation.
  \item Secondly, restricting the user to work with a single
data format greatly simplifies data management for
those less familiar with programming environments.
}
As part of this work several \code{openair} coding
conventions were adopted, most importantly that data
sets should include a column named \code{date} of
\code{‘POSIX’} class data-and-time-stamps
(\code{\link{DateTimeClasses}}).
This and other conventions, such as the use of
\code{ws} and \code{wd} for numeric wind speed and
direction data-series, and \code{site} and \code{code}
for character or factor monitoring site name and
identifier code, are now commonplace for many working
with R in the air quality research community, and many
air quality archives provide data in (or support import
functions that convert their own data structures to)
this \code{openair}-friendly structure.
