Package: AQEval
Title: Air Quality Evaluation
Version: 0.6.10
Date: 2026-03-01
Description: Developed for use by those tasked with the routine detection, characterisation and
            quantification of discrete changes in air quality time-series, such as identifying the impacts
            of air quality policy interventions. The main functions use signal isolation then
            break-point/segment (BP/S) methods based on 'strucchange' and 'segmented' methods to detect and
            quantify change events (Ropkins & Tate, 2021, <doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142374>).
