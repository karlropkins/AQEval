Title: Air Quality Evaluation
Version: 0.4.5
Date: 2022-04-13
Description: Developed for use by those tasked with the routine detection,
        characterisation and quantification of discrete changes in air
        quality time-series, such as identifying the impacts of air quality
        policy interventions. The main functions use signal isolation then
        break-point/segment (BP/S) methods based on 'strucchange' and 
        'segmented' methods detect and quantify change events (Ropkins & 
        Tate, 2021, <doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142374>).
