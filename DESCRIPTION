Title: Air Quality Evaluation
Version: 0.6.1
Date: 2025-02-07
Description: Developed for use by those tasked with the routine detection, characterisation
          and quantification of discrete changes in air quality time-series, such as
          identifying the impacts of air quality policy interventions. The main functions use
          signal isolation then break-point/segment (BP/S) methods based on 'strucchange' and
          'segmented' methods to detect and quantify change events (Ropkins & Tate, 2021,
          <doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142374>).
